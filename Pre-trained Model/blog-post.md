## What is a pre-trained model? 

1) short description (guides training data to a general description of classes and features).

2) models for language, general use, not a huge selection for biology.

3) what is of specific interest to biologists?


## Problems for application to biology.

1) amount of input data.

2) multivariate feature space.

3) models do not equal phenomenology.

4) not customized for biological problems (universality vs. particularism).


## Modeling a biological image.

1) requires modeling a bunch of different tasks, when a single set of attributes might yield more information.

2) context may allow us to forego large amounts of training data.

3) "blobs" vs. "symbols" -- rival strategies for complex processes and data.
